    Make sure to retrieve the complete transcript and format it properly.

preprocessing_task:
  description: >
    Clean and prepare the transcript for summarization. Remove any unnecessary elements like 
    timestamps, repetitions, filler words, and fix any formatting issues. Ensure the text is 
    well-structured and ready for summarization.
  expected_output: >
    A cleaned and preprocessed version of the transcript that is optimized for summarization.
  agent: preprocessing_agent
  context: [transcript_task]

summarization_task:
  description: >
    Create a concise summary of the preprocessed transcript that captures all the key points, 
    main ideas, and important details. The summary should be comprehensive yet significantly 
    shorter than the original transcript. Organize the summary in a logical structure with 
    sections, bullet points, or paragraphs as appropriate.
    
    Create a professional, well-structured summary with appropriate headings, subheadings, and 
    formatting. The summary should be ready for direct publication without further editing.
    Do not include meta-commentary about the summary itself - only include the actual content summary.
    Give the summary an appropriate title based on the video content.
  expected_output: >
    A complete, polished summary of the transcript that accurately represents the 
    content of the video. The summary should be professionally formatted in markdown with 
    clear sections, proper headings, and a logical structure.

evaluation_task:
  description: >
    Evaluate the summary for accuracy, completeness, and faithfulness to the original transcript. 
    Check that all key points are included, no important information is missing, and no incorrect 
    information has been added. The summary should be rated on a scale of 1-10, and only summaries 
    with a score of 7 or higher should be approved. 
    
    IMPORTANT: DO NOT include your evaluation in the output file. Instead, if the summary is approved, 
    pass through the actual summary content exactly as provided by the summarization agent to be saved 
    as the output file. Only perform the evaluation internally to decide whether to save the summary or not.
  expected_output: >
    The actual summary content if approved (score â‰¥ 7), or a message indicating that the summary was not
    approved if the score is less than 7. Your evaluation comments should only be printed during execution,
    not included in the output file.
