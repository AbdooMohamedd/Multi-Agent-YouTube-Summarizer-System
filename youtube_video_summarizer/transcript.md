It’s the summer of 1971 and several college 
students are being arrested at their homes by Palo  
Alto California police and charged" with armed 
robbery, and burglary, Penal Codes 211, and 459.
Although none of these men had 
previously committed a crime,  
college students getting 
arrested is not a unique thing.
Slightly out of the ordinary the men had a good 
idea this would be happening and stranger still  
the whole event is being filmed.
All of this although odd could feasibly happen, 
but the whole pantomime has a strangely fake  
feeling about it, maybe the alleged criminals are 
more hardened that their records would suggest.
No passers by would know this but all of 
the men are being paid to be arrested,  
but not by some organized crime 
group but instead by a university.
What is actually happening is the beginning of  
one of the most controversial and 
well known psychological studies.
The experiment's orchestrator 
would have to end the study short  
as the participants would take 
things beyond what he expected.
Today we are looking at the 
Stanford prison experiment.  
I'm going to rate this one at the end 
of the video. Let's see if you’ll agree?
Philip George Zimbardo was born on 23 March 
1933 in New York, New York s, United States.
In his early years he suffered 
discrimination due to his itialian ancestry,  
and was often carelessly mistaken 
for a multitude of other races.
The young Zimbardo, like many other 
people covered in this series,  
used this all too common human behavior 
as a spark for his interest in psychology.
In the early 1950s he attended Brooklyn college 
graduating with a B.A. boasting 3 majors,  
in psychology, sociology and anthropology.
The next year he went on to earn a 
MA and by 1959 had also earned a PHD,  
both from Yale in psychology.
Zimbardo Briefly stayed on at Yale to 
teach psychology from 1959 to 1960,  
whilst there he married Rose Abdelnour and had a 
son in 1962, but he left Yale when offered a job  
as a professor at new york university, 
where he would stay in the role until 1967.
In 1967 he would move again to 
columbia university, which would be  
brief as he was offered a facility staff 
position at stanford university in 1968.
Just 3 years later he was offered  
and accepted In 1971, a tenured 
position as a professor of psychology.
The same year Zimbardo and Rose would 
deviorce, as a side note Rose was a  
very well accomplished academic in her own 
right, specialising in english literature.
And this rather quickly brings us  
onto the experiment that would 
write zimbardo's name in history.
Zimbardo was interested in how the US prison 
system had seemed to foster a pure hatred between  
prisoners and guards, was the explanation for this 
purely down to the nature of the people involved?
For example, are the conditions bad 
because criminals are bad or because  
the administrators are likely to be harsh? 
In reality it is probably impossible to  
know and it feels like a chicken and egg 
situation, as if prisoners break the rules  
then the rules are made tougher leading 
to more prisoners breaking the rules.
Naturally both sides of the bars would distrust 
one another, which can create a downward spiral.
One thing that is true today as it was in 
the 1970s is such high recidivism rates,  
as rehabilitation is rare, purley by the nature of 
being a prisoner you become isolated from society.
And this isn't unique to the US. We have 
very much the same situation here in the UK.
But what if you can eliminate 
the deep rooted hatred between  
those in the cells and those with the keys.
This is where Zimbardo comes in, as you can get 
rid of this hatred by using a randomly selected  
group of people who were neither guards or 
prisoners, by splitting these random people  
into the different roles, you've created 
the scene of a prison without the natural  
distrust between the administrators of 
the law and the breakers of the law.
Zimbardo managed to secure financing for this 
experiment from the US Office of the Navy. 
The Navy wanted to understand 
antisocial behavior and by  
extension wanted to investigate conflict 
between military guards and prisoners.
His experiment would involve university students 
playing the role of guards and prisoners,  
for a princely sum of $15 per day.
Zimbardo would be the research team leader  
and would in 1997 in Stanford 
university news interview say:
“I wondered, along with my research 
associates Craig Haney, Curtis Banks and  
Carlo Prescott, what would happen if 
we aggregated all of these processes,  
making some subjects feel deindividuated, others 
dehumanized within an anonymous environment  
in the same experimental setting, and where we 
could carefully document the process over time."
To find his subjects Zimbardo put out 
this advert in the “help wanted" section  
of the Palo Alto Times,
Male college students needed for 
psychological study of prison life.  
$15 per day for 1–2 weeks, beginning Aug. 
14. For further information and applications,  
come to room 248 Jordan Hall, Stanford University.
75 men would answer the ad and after interviews 
and suitably screening which set out to exclude  
anyone with a criminal record, mental health 
condition or any other medical issues.
24 from this initial 75 would be selected; the 
group was predominantly white and middle-class  
and had no apparent health, aggression 
or legal issues in their life.
In order to try and keep the results scientific  
each participant was randomly given 
one of two roles: prisoner or guard.
In total 9 were in each group with 3 substitutes.
The group labeled as prisoners were told 
that they would not experience physical abuse  
but would lose their civil 
liberties for between 1 and 2 weeks.
Little else was given to them in terms of what 
would be expected of them, only that they would  
be contacted by telephone to be at their residence 
on a given Sunday for the experiment to begin.
All signed a contract stating that 
medical care, housing, clothing and  
adequate food would be provided as well as 
the 15$ per day in payment for their time.
The guards had a little more 
guidance before the experiment,  
as they would be issued uniforms and equipment 
on the day before commencement of the study.
The equipment given to them consisted of a 
generic law enforcement inspired uniform,  
mirrored glasses to prevent the prisoners from 
making eye contact, as well as wooden batons. 
On the orientation day the guards were 
introduced to Zimbardo who would be acting as  
the superintendent, and an undergraduate research 
assistant who would play the role of the warden.
They were told that their assigned task was 
to maintain a reasonable degree of order,  
to allow the prison to function properly, 
but weren't told how they could achieve this.
They were also told to be prepared for any 
unexpected incident such as escape attempts,  
and that they would have to write a daily 
shift report, on guard and prisoner activities,  
as well as critical incident reports 
on any out of the ordinary event.
During this time they were also told they would 
be responsible for the administration of meals,  
work and recreational activities of the prisoners.
The guards believed that the experiment was 
solely to see how the prisoners would act,  
but actually Zimbardo's team was equally 
interested in their approach to the  
prison experience and as such they were given 
deliberately vague instructions on their conduct.
And finally to help immerse the guards further, 
they assisted in the construction of the prison.
Now the participants were chosen  
somewhere that had to be built for them 
to play out their new assigned roles.
The university allowed Zimbardo's research 
team to use a part of the basement  
of the Stanford psychology 
department's Jordan hall.
The 35ft long area seemed perfect for the role  
with little outside light and an essentially 
cut off from the outside world feel.
There were 3 cells which 
were originally office rooms,  
that could accommodate 3 participants in 
each and measuring at 9x6 was pretty cramped.
Each man had a cot with a pillow, 
blanket and mattress and that was it,  
no daylight and no clock, all of which 
were designed to make the prisoners lose  
track of time., and the subjects would be 
locked up here for nearly 24 hours a day.
Each cell also had an intercom wire up so the 
experimenters could listen into conversations  
and to make public announcements.
There was a closet that would 
be used as solitary confinement  
and measured in a coffin like 2x2x7 ft.
The prison area, which was previously 
a corridor with the offices off of it,  
had 2 fabricated walls, one for the entrance 
and another for a small observation screen,  
the space between these walls and 
the prison cells was called the yard.
To use the toilet prisoners were escorted 
blindfolded as to further disorientate them.
The guards' accommodation 
was completely the opposite  
with areas to change clothes after their shifts,  
plenty of space to move around on down time and 
plenty of opportunities for rest and relaxation.
And this brings us on to the beginning 
of the experiment, Sunday, August 15.
A Palo Alto Police car pulls up outside a 
residence, a young man is taken outside,  
searched, handcuffed, given their rights 
and put into the back of a vehicle,  
onlookers stop to see the unfolding drama, this 
same scene would play out for 8 more people.
The 9 men are taken to the police 
station where they are fingerprinted,  
have their details taken down, have a police 
file opened on them and placed in a holding cell.
Pretty much the standard for an alleged 
criminal, although after a short while,  
each of the men are blind folded and bundled into 
a car and driven to the stanford mock prison.
Once arriving in the prison 
each prisoner was stripped,  
sprayed with deodorant which was 
standing in for delousing spray,  
and made to stand naked in the yard for some 
time before being given a prisoners uniform,  
from there they were photographed for a 
mugshot and given an identification number.
After this the prisoner was shown to their cell  
and locked away in the process 
being told to remain silent.
When everyone was on boarded to 
their new home for the next 2 weeks,  
the warden went to introduce themselves, and 
read each of the men the rules of the prison,  
which had been created by the guards earlier.
The prison rules and their id number had to 
be memorized and would be asked 3 times a day  
during roll call once for each guard shift.
The prisoners were only to be 
identified by their number,  
this was a further effort to 
de-personalise each inmate.
Every day the prisoners 
were scheduled for work time  
to earn their 15$ per day and they were 
also allowed exercise and movie time.
On top of this 2 visit 
periods were allowed per week.
But these rules would be modified and 
degrade over the course of the study.
Data during the study would be collected 
by zimbardo's team in a number of ways,
Filming the whole study, audio 
recordings from hidden microphones,  
rating scales taken of both guards and prisoners, 
and before the whole experiment all participants  
undertook a series of paper 
and pencil personality tests.
1
Back to the first day Sunday 15th August, after 
their interaction with the warden and tasked with  
memorizing the rules the prisoners were left in 
their cells to settle in for the night. 12:30
But that night would not be a quiet one 
when the first count was to be undertaken..
2
At 02:30 on the 16th of august the prisoners 
were rudely awakened by the guards,  
needless to say this wouldn’t go down well.
The prisoners were at this point still 
trying to assert their independence  
and thus didn’t take the count seriously.
Many of the Prisoners refused to leave their 
cells, ripped off their inmate number tags,  
took off their stocking caps 
and insulted the guards.
The now unexpected rebellion 
spilled into the morning shift,  
by now the prisoners had barricaded 
the cells with their cots.
The morning guards, frustrated with the 
rebellion in the early hours of the 2nd day,  
called up the reserve guards who were at home 
and insisted on the night personnel to stay on.
In a surprising ramping up of violence the 
guards decided to use a fire extinguisher  
in the prison cells to quell the rebellion.
Further still the guards removed 
all of the prisoners’ clothes,  
removed mattresses and sentenced the 
main instigators time in The Hole.
The rebellion was quashed but 
clearly the guards had a problem.  
All 9 couldn’t be there all the time so how 
to effectively manage the inmates behavior,  
and one person suggested psychological methods.
On the Monday night, in less than 36 hours after  
the experiment had begun, Zimbardo was 
forced to release one of the prisoners  
due to them showing signs of a mental breakdown.
Before release the prisoner was treated with  
skepticism, and was offered a place as an 
informant in exchange of improved conditions,  
but he refused, and was thus released.
One of the three cells was to be used  
as a privileged cell. The three 
prisoners least involved in the  
rebellion were given special treatment.
They got their uniforms and their beds back,  
and were allowed to wash and brush their 
teeth. The other prisoners were not. 
On top of this they also were allowed to 
eat special food in front of the others,  
all of this was intended to break 
the solidarity of the prisoners. 
After half a day of this 
the 3 privileged prisoners  
were returned to the remaining inmate population. 
This also sowed doubt amongst the other prisoners 
as to whether the privileged 3 were informers. 
Prisoners were not allowed to use the toilet 
after lights out and instead provided a bucket  
to relieve themselves, which inturn was not 
allowed to be removed from the cell by the guards. 
3
On day 3 the Tuesday,  
a visit was allowed from friends and family, in 
order to reduce the risk of complaints from the  
outside world, the prisoners were cleaned, shaved 
and fed, furthermore their cells were cleaned.
To immerse the families in the 
experiment They had to register,  
were made to wait half an hour, and were told 
that only two visitors could see each prisoner. 
The total visiting time was cut to 
only ten minutes,and was undertaken  
under the surveillance of a guard.
Before any family members could enter  
the visiting area, they had to discuss 
their son's case with the warden. 
Many of the prisoners complained about 
the rules, but were seeming to comply.  
Interestingly, the family members, rather than 
straight up complaining at their loved ones' tired  
and disheveled look, actually looked to improve 
the situation by appealing to the superintendent.
One mother said "I'm sorry; I don't want to 
make any trouble, but he seems so tired."  
after zimbardo asked her what 
the problem was with her son.
After visiting hours a rumour had started to 
spread that prisoner 8612, the one who was  
released on the monday, was actually only 
pretending he was suffering in the prison,  
and that he was going to 
return to do a mass breakout.
Zimbardo's team bizarrely, now fully 
invested in the prison themselves,  
decided to place a new prisoner in the cell that 
8612 had occupied, who was actually an informer.
The study lead then went to the Palo Alto 
Police Department and asked if he could  
have all the prisoners transferred to their jail, 
this request was refused due to insurance issues.
Even more strangely, Zimbardo then decided to 
dismantle the jail immediately after visitation,  
call in reinforcement guards, take all the 
prisoners, place a bag over their heads  
and escort them in an elevator, 
to a fifth floor storage room  
to be hidden away from any breakout attempt.
Zimbardo was then to wait in the location of  
the now closed prison to confront any would-be 
liberator, to inform them that everyone had been  
sent home and the experiment was over, only 
to then resume after the coast was clear. 
The prison break never materialised, 
The rumor turned out to be just a rumor. 
Once the prison was restarted, the guards 
continued to act sadistically to the prisoners,  
by again refusing access to the toilet and 
forcing the men to do push ups for hours on end. 
Another interesting thing the guards were doing 
was increasing the time it would take to do a  
count, from just 10 minutes to several hours.
4 
On day 4 wednesday the 18th zimbardo 
invited a catholic priest to the prison  
to assess the situation, the invited 
clergy member had previously been a  
chaplain at a washington dc corrections facility.
He interviewed each of the prisoners individually,  
interestingly half the prisoners he 
spoke to, introduced themselves by  
giving their numbers rather than their name.
The priest asked each man “what are you doing  
to get out of here?", when confronted with 
confusion from the inmates the priest replied:  
“if they didn't help themselves, nobody 
else would, that they were college students;  
they were bright enough to realize that 
they were in prison and that the only way  
to get out of prison was with a lawyer.”
This meeting crushed all little hope of  
the prisoners that this was an experiment.
Prisoner 819 was the only one to refuse to speak  
to the chaplain, instead insisting for a doctor,  
eventually He was convinced to come out and 
talk to the priest and the superintendent so  
that he could be diagnosed what his problem was 
and what kind of medical practitioner he needed. 
819 was escorted to a side room given food and 
had his leg chains removed, upon his removal,  
the prison guards made the remaining 
inmates chant 819 is a bad prisoner. 
This sent 819 into a hysterical fit 
of cryingWhen Zimbardo said that it  
was time to leave the experiment the 
prisoner replied, "No, I can't leave." 
819 didn't want to leave but instead wanted to go 
back in to prove he was not bad, shocked, Zimbardo  
broke character of the superintendent, and 
reassured that the whole thing was an experiment. 
The guards had now started using bags over the 
prisoners heads as a routine form of punishment. 
After 819’s departure he was replaced 
by Prisoner #416, one of the study  
standbys.
5
The 5th day, Thursday the19th, marked another 
part of prison life, a parole hearing. 20:08 
The prisoners were chained together and ushered 
into the parole board meeting with bags over their  
heads so that they could not see or talk.
The parole board were formed of people  
none of the prisoners had seen before, and 
each man was asked the question, would you  
forfeit the money you have earned so far to be 
paroled, unsurprisingly every inmate said yes. 
The head of the board was Carlo Prescott, 
the experiments consultant and ex-convict,  
even he had embraced his assigned role.
At the end of the parole board meeting  
each person was told to go back to their cell 
and the board would consider their request.  
Everyone of them did so docility, that 
it was clear their sense of reality  
was completely warped, even giving up 
the money, which was the sole reason  
for them being there in the first place.
This would have been a perfect opportunity  
for the subjects to quit, but they by now were 
mindlessly following any order given to them. 
Zimbardo had now observed the guards form into 3 
different types, Good guys who were sympathetic to  
the prisoners, tough but fair guards whose orders 
were always within the rules of prison operation,  
and finally the sadistic, who for any reason 
would punish and humiliate the inmates. 
By now the prisoners had 
become completely introverted  
and all bonds had broken within the cells.
One final act of rebellion manifested itself  
in prisoner 416 whom had been the 
stand in brough in the day before. 
He went on a hunger strike, the guards tried 
to make him eat but to no avail, interestingly  
his co inmates turned against him, seeing 
this last stand as an act of trouble making. 
The guards after attempting to 
force feed the inmate even roped  
the other prisoners into forcing him, 
as part of the psychological warfare  
everyone in the cells was threatened 
with punishment unless 416 would eat. 
Visits from loved ones planned for the evening 
was taken off the table, and this was moment  
the inmates completely turned on 416 screaming 
at him, cursing him, telling him he had to eat,  
even saying that they weren't going to be 
inconvenienced by his stupid act of defiance. 
416 was bundled into solitary 
confinement for 3 hours,  
even though the agreed maximum time was 1 hour.
The head guard on that shift unluckily for 416  
was the most sadistic nicknamed john wayne, he 
gave the prisoners a choice, 416 out of solitary  
in exchange for their blankets or they could 
keep them and 416 would stay locked up all night. 
The prisoners opted to keep their blankets.
During visiting time that evening a number  
of the inmates' parents requested Zimbardo contact 
a lawyer in order to get their son out of prison. 
A lawyer was called up and attended for 
interviews of each of the prisoners. 
The prison had completely devolved into the 
harshest guards realm with the good guards not  
challenging immoral acts and even enabling them.
The evenings were worse for arbitrary punishment,  
when the guards thought the 
experimenters weren't watching. 
Enter Christina Maslach, a recent PHD 
student and Early in her professional career,  
visited the prison, she was very well known 
to zimbardo, and a year later would marry him. 
She was shocked to discover the 
horrendous conditions of the experiment,  
and appealed to Zimbardo, stating his lack of 
caring oversight, and the immorality of the study. 
Additionally, she pointed out that Zimbardo had 
been changed by his role as Superintendent in the  
experiment into someone she did not like.
This in addition to the obvious signs of  
deterioration of the mental well being of the 
prisoners, led to the beginning of the end of  
the stanford prison experiment.
6 
On the 6th day Friday, August 
20, the study was cancelled  
over a week earlier than intended, the final 
day involved debriefing of both study groups. 
The Encounter groups as zimbardo called them 
were undertaken First with all the guards,  
then with all the prisoners including those 
who had been released and had been invited to  
corne back, and then finally a meeting for all 
the guards and prisoners and staff together. 
This allowed all the participants time 
to get their feelings out in the open,  
and to start a kind of moral 
reconciliation between all involved. 
Questionnaires similar to the ones 
filled out at the start of the study  
were given to each participant to be 
filled out and posted to zimbaro’s team. 
Even though the experiment ended early the 
full amount for the 14 days was paid to each  
participant, $210 roughly $1400 in 2021 money.
Finally, all participants were invited to  
return to the university a week later 
to share their opinions and emotions. 
And thus the experiment was over.
But what of the results, well zimbardo  
interpreted the results that it wasn’t the 
individual personalities of the participants  
but the prison itself that shaped the outcome.
Afterall Zimbardo had taken in every other way  
normal people at random and merely applied 
different roles, be it prisoner or guard. 
The two groups even had the same goal for entering 
the study and that was to get some extra money for  
2 weeks of apparently on the outset easy work.
Zimbardo took the experiment as an example  
of situational attribution where the 
environment shapes the person's actions,  
he compared the prison experiment to that 
of Stanley Milgram's study 10 years earlier. 
Where the perceived authority 
of a scientist resulted  
in study participants administering potentially 
deadly electric shocks to another person. 
Although personality was thought not to be the 
reason for the way the prison experiment played  
out, Zimbardo did concede that the individual did 
affect certain outcomes, such as the individual  
level of rebelliousness of the prisoners and 
the level of cruelty shown by the guards. 
The experiment almost immediately invited 
criticism for the ethical way it was conducted,  
exposing the prisoners to a high 
risk of psychological injury. 
And tying the experiment to another controversial 
experiment, unsurprisingly didn't help. 
The apparent chaos in which 
the experiment devolved into  
meant that Zimbardo's team's 
conclusions were pretty anecdotal  
and relied on the experimenter's subjective 
understanding of the individual's behavior. 
The guards were actively encouraged to 
"participate" more and be more "tough"  
for the benefit of the experiment by 
David Jaffe who was acting as the warden. 
Subsequent attempts to 
recreate the results failed. 
Another criticism comes from Zimbardo taking 
on the role as superintendent himself,  
which gave him the excuse of himself being 
influenced by the situation of the prison. 
HIs role allowed him to directly 
influence the outcome of the experiment,  
and through a thing called demand characteristics, 
subconsciously influenced the participants  
to subconsciously act out the stereotypes 
of the roles they were assigned. 
Furthermore the advert for participants 
asked for volunteers for a prison experiment  
and thus opens Zimbardo to the criticism of 
selection bias on the part of the volunteers. 
The bbc recreated the experiment 
loosely in 2002 for a tv  
series called rather blandly the experiment.
The results of this study failed to replicate  
zimbardo's conclusions, when the guards did not 
naturally fall into the role of a tyrannical  
prison hells cape, and interestingly the 
prisoners held on to their sense of independence  
resulting in comradery within the inmates.
There was even a late experiment breakout attempt. 
But funnily enough this experiment was too 
finished early due to guards and prisoners wanting  
to start a new much harsher Stanford style regime.
Zimbardo is still alive today and since  
the Stanford prison experiment has 
released multiple papers and books. 
Including introductory psychology 
textbooks for college students,  
and other notable works, including The Lucifer 
Effect, The Time Paradox, and The Time Cure. 
Reportedly none of the subjects had any adverse 
effects due to the experiment apart from the time  
actually spent at the Stanford county jail.
Now where would you rate this subject of  
my ethical scale 1 being all 
ok and 9 being pure evil,I’m  
going to rate the Stanford prison experiment a 6.
This is mainly due to the questionable results and  
uncomfortable living conditions of the 
prisoners, even though there were apparently no  
long term effects on its subjects.
